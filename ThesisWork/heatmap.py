    This heatmap is a visual tool that helps you understand the relationship between three different measurements of fish: their total length, weight, and a ratio of weight to length. It uses colors to show how these measurements are related: if the color is closer to blue, it means they are strongly linked in a positive way, while red shows a strong negative relationship. If the color is closer to white, it means there is little or no connection between them. This makes it easier to see patterns or connections at a glance. This helps answer questions like: Do longer fish usually weigh more?  A weaker correlation here might suggest that as fish get longer, their shape (and weight-to-length ratio) varies more. It gives you a birdâ€™s-eye view of how fish traits behave together. This can help spot patterns across species or identify what measurements matter most when trying to understand fish growth and condition.
