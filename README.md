🧭 Overview
Outdoor Analytics is a centralized, interactive web dashboard designed to enhance the fishing experience through real-time data visualization, logging, and mapping. 
Built with anglers, marine biologists, and environmental researchers in mind, the platform streamlines data collection and provides actionable insights to promote 
sustainable fishing practices.

🚀 Features:
📍 Interactive Map Plotter using Folium

📊 Visual Data Analysis with Plotly

📅 Fishing Trip Logger using CSV-based storage

🌦️ Real-Time Weather API Integration

🐟 Species & Catch Data Visualization

💡 User-friendly interface built with Streamlit

🔧 Technologies Used:
Python

Streamlit – Web application framework

Folium – Mapping and location plotting

Plotly – Data visualization

Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis

OpenWeatherMap API – Live weather data

📈 Motivation
Traditional fishing data collection methods (handwritten logs, scattered apps, or memory) are inefficient and error-prone. This dashboard centralizes everything into one
intuitive platform, aiding not only casual and professional fishermen but also researchers looking to analyze ecological and behavioral trends in aquatic life.

🌱 Future Improvements:
🔐 User Authentication

🗄️ Database Integration

📡 More Real-Time APIs (e.g., tide levels, moon phase)

☁️ Cloud Hosting / Deployment

🔁 Automatic Dataset Updates

📍 Use Cases:
Recreational and sport fishermen logging and analyzing trip data

Marine biologists tracking fish population trends

🖥️ Running the Dashboard
To run locally:

bash
